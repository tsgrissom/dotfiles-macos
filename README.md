# tsgrissom/dotfiles

This is my public collection of personal dotfiles, including configuration files for oh-my-zsh, tmux, neovim, and more.

## Disclaimer

If you want to try using these dotfiles, you should review what they do first. Using another person's configurations, shell scripts, etc. is a hazardous and discouraged practice. With that, these files are offered without condition and it is up to the end-user to ensure they are a proper fit, caveat emptor.
