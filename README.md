# tsgrissom/dotfiles

This is my public collection of personal dotfiles, including configuration files for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), and more.

While the tools used in these dotfiles are almost always available for Linux, these dotfiles were created for and tested using macOS. You might need to tinker in order to get the configured options to function as expected.

Preferred terminal emulator: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)

## Tools

### Neovim

* Lua scripting is preferred where possible
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is my plugin manager of choice

### Oh My Zsh

Plugin requirements:

* [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)
* [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
* [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

## Disclaimer

If you want to try using these dotfiles, you should review what they do first. Using another person's configurations, shell scripts, etc. is a hazardous and discouraged practice. With that, these files are offered without condition and it is up to the end-user to ensure they are a proper fit, caveat emptor.
